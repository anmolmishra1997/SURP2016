Points-
1. A lot of S shaped curves are observed in number of cells before it starts oscillating
2. Volume heterogeneity almost always starts decreasing after tend ( although in an oscillatory fashion) before it reaches equilibrium oscillations
3. Surface heterogeneity shows a peculiar dependence after tend, it first increases then decreases
4. Volume distribution, has the expected behaviour, distribution's mean shifts more and more left as time increases under constrained growth.
5. Surface distribution does not show much change, the peak seems to be about the same point
6. The free space decreases slowly eventually, but the rate increases as cell number increases which is expected
7. In the removal of PDMS case, volume distribution for 2R circle is much more to the left, as compared to the other two.
8. Although not possible to observe very clearly in phase 2 due to high MCS, between tend and tend + 100, rate of cell growth decreases
